# customer-churn-prediction
A Data Analytics project to predict customer churn using logistic regression

This project predicts whether a customer will churn or not using logistic regression.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- Dataset: Telco Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle)
- Goal: Predict churn using features like tenure, contract type, monthly charges, etc.
- Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, Google Colab
- Model: Logistic Regression
- Accuracy Achieved: 79%

## 📊 Key Insights

- Customers with month-to-month contracts have higher churn rates.
- Higher monthly charges correlate with increased churn likelihood.
- Longer-tenured customers are less likely to churn.

## 📁 Project Structure

- churn_prediction.ipynb: Main notebook containing all EDA, preprocessing, modeling steps.

## ✨ What I Learned

- Data cleaning and visualization
- Logistic Regression model building
- Model evaluation using accuracy and classification report
